Hi Rustaceans!

The Rust Community team is happy to announce the Rust Community blog!

This blog is both intended as our regular outlet for community topics, as well as to highlight community events - meetups, usergroups or out of the order events.

If you have a community topic you would like to write about here, please [contact us](mailto:community-team@rust-lang.org), or just [open an issue](https://github.com/rust-community/blog.community.rs). Please note that we consider this blog a curated resources, so expect an editing process.

In the meantime, we'll kick off the blog with a series of posts describing the rust community team, some of its action and our recommendations for community action.
